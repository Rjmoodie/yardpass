## 🏗️ Database Architecture

### **Schema Organization**
```
├── public/          # User-facing data with RLS
│   ├── users, orgs, events, tickets, orders
│   ├── posts, comments, reactions, follows
│   └── ticketing & analytics tables
├── reference/       # Static reference data (no RLS needed)
│   ├── spatial_ref_sys, geometry_columns
│   ├── event_categories, event_tags
│   └── lookup tables
├── internal/        # System data (API excluded)
│   ├── config, rate_limits
│   └── job_queue
└── analytics/       # Reporting data
    ├── user_analytics
    └── event_analytics
```

### **Key Features Implemented**
- **Location Services**: PostGIS integration with secure spatial functions
- **Full-Text Search**: Advanced search with relevance scoring
- **Access Control**: Multi-level permissions (general/vip/crew)
- **Real-time Analytics**: User and event tracking
- **Background Jobs**: Queue system for async processing
- **Rate Limiting**: API protection infrastructure

## 🛡️ Security Status

### **✅ Resolved Issues**
- **RLS Policies**: All user tables have appropriate access policies
- **Function Security**: All functions use secure search paths
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data properly isolated

### **⚠️ Expected Warnings (Safe)**
- **PostGIS Extensions**: System extensions in public schema (cannot be moved)
- **Spatial Reference Table**: System table RLS warning (expected for PostGIS)
- **Auth Configuration**: OTP/password settings (configurable in Supabase dashboard)

## 🚀 Performance Features

### **Indexes for Scale**
- **Ticketing**: Optimized for QR code scans, user lookups, event queries
- **Events**: Location-based queries, date ranges, status filtering
- **Search**: Full-text and similarity search capabilities
- **Analytics**: Time-series data access patterns

### **Functions & Triggers**
- **Spatial Queries**: Distance calculation, nearby events
- **Access Control**: User permission checking
- **Data Integrity**: Automatic timestamp updates
- **Security**: Secure reference data access
