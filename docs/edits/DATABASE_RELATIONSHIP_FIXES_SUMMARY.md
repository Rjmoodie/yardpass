# ✅ **DATABASE RELATIONSHIP FIXES - COMPLETE**

## 🔍 **Critical Issues Identified & Resolved**

### **1. ❌ Table Naming Inconsistencies**
**Problem**: Code was trying to query `organizations` table but database had `orgs` table.

**✅ Solution**: 
- Created `organizations` view from `orgs` table for backward compatibility
- Updated edge functions to use correct table names
- Ensured consistent naming throughout the codebase

```sql
-- Created organizations view for backward compatibility
CREATE VIEW public.organizations AS
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    slug,
    description,
    logo_url as avatar_url,
    website_url,
    is_verified,
    settings,
    created_at,
    updated_at
FROM public.orgs;
```

### **2. ❌ Missing Event Relationships**
**Problem**: Events table missing proper organizer relationships.

**✅ Solution**:
- Added `organizer_id` column to events table
- Added `org_id` column for backward compatibility
- Created proper foreign key constraints
- Established relationships with `orgs` table

```sql
-- Added organizer relationship columns
ALTER TABLE public.events ADD COLUMN organizer_id UUID REFERENCES public.orgs(id);
ALTER TABLE public.events ADD COLUMN org_id UUID REFERENCES public.orgs(id);
```

### **3. ❌ Cultural Guides Table Missing**
**Problem**: Event queries failing due to missing `cultural_guides` table.

**✅ Solution**:
- Created `cultural_guides` table with proper structure
- Added RLS policies for security
- Established relationships with events table
- Added sample data for testing

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.cultural_guides (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    event_id UUID REFERENCES public.events(id) ON DELETE CASCADE UNIQUE,
    themes TEXT[],
    community_context TEXT,
    history_long TEXT,
    etiquette_tips TEXT[],
    archive_media JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    cultural_sensitivity_score DECIMAL(3, 2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **4. ❌ Event Loading Failures**
**Problem**: Event detail pages consistently failing to load with 400 errors.

**✅ Solution**:
- Created comprehensive `events_with_details` view
- Added `get_event_by_slug` helper function
- Fixed query patterns and relationships
- Ensured proper data access patterns

```sql
-- Created comprehensive event view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.events_with_details AS
SELECT 
    e.*,
    o.id as organizer_id,
    o.name as organizer_name,
    o.slug as organizer_slug,
    -- ... all organizer details
    cg.themes as cultural_themes,
    -- ... all cultural guide details
    COUNT(DISTINCT t.id) as ticket_tier_count,
    -- ... all aggregated data
FROM public.events e
LEFT JOIN public.orgs o ON e.organizer_id = o.id OR e.org_id = o.id
LEFT JOIN public.cultural_guides cg ON e.id = cg.event_id
-- ... all necessary joins
GROUP BY e.id, o.id, cg.themes, cg.community_context, cg.etiquette_tips;
```

## 🔍 **Verification Steps**

### **1. Database Verification**:
```sql
-- Check if orgs table exists
SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables 
    WHERE table_name = 'orgs' 
    AND table_schema = 'public'
);

-- Check if organizations view exists
SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.views 
    WHERE table_name = 'organizations' 
    AND table_schema = 'public'
);

-- Check if events_with_details view exists
SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.views 
    WHERE table_name = 'events_with_details' 
    AND table_schema = 'public'
);

-- Check if get_event_by_slug function exists
SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.routines 
    WHERE routine_name = 'get_event_by_slug' 
    AND routine_schema = 'public'
);
```

### **2. Code Verification**:
